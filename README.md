# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start-backend`

Runs the backend app in the development mode.\
The server is accessible via[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### `npm start` | `npm run start-frontend`

Runs the frontend app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

<b>WITHOUT THE BACKEND server running, the frontend WON'T WORK properly!</b>

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
